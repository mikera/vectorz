/**
 * <p>
 * This is an abstract class for computing the singular value decomposition
 * (SVD) of a matrix, which is defined as:<br>
 * <div align=center> A = U * W * V <sup>T</sup> </div><br>
 * where A is m by n, and U and V are orthogonal matrices, and W is a diagonal
 * matrix.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The dimension of U,W,V depends if it is a compact SVD or not. If not compact
 * then U is m by m, W is m by n, V is n by n. If compact then let s be the
 * number of singular values, U is m by s, W is s by s, and V is n by s.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Accessor functions for decomposed matrices can return an internally
 * constructed matrix if null is passed in for the optional storage parameter.
 * The exact behavior is implementation specific. If an internally maintained
 * matrix is returned then on the next call to decompose the matrix will be
 * modified. The advantage of this approach is reduced memory overhead.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To create a new instance of SingularValueDecomposition see
 * {@link org.ejml.factory.DecompositionFactory#svd(int, int, boolean, boolean, boolean)}
 * and {@link org.ejml.ops.SingularOps} contains additional helpful SVD related
 * functions.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>*Note*</b> that the ordering of singular values is not guaranteed, unless
 * done so by a specific implementation. The singular values can be put into
 * descending order while adjusting U and V using
 * {@link org.ejml.ops.SingularOps#descendingOrder(org.ejml.data.DenseMatrix, boolean, org.ejml.data.DenseMatrix, org.ejml.data.DenseMatrix, boolean)}
 * SingularOps.descendingOrder()}.
