 * LU Decomposition refactors the original matrix such that:<br>
 * <div align=center> P<sup>T</sup>*L*U = A</div> where P is a pivot matrix, L
 * is a lower triangular matrix, U is an upper triangular matrix and A is the
 * original matrix.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * LU Decomposition is useful since once the decomposition has been performed
 * linear equations can be quickly solved and the original matrix A inverted.
 * Different algorithms can be selected to perform the decomposition, all will
 * have the same end result.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use this class first specify the size of the matrix that will be
 * decomposed by it in the constructor. Only square m by m matrices can be
 * decomposed. Then to decompose a matrix call {@link #decompose}. If it
 * encounters any problems an exception will be thrown. After that all the other
 * functions will be available for solving and inverting matrices.
