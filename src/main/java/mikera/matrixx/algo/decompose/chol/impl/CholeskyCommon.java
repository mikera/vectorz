 * A Cholesky Decomposition is a special decomposition for positive-definite symmetric matrices
 * that is more efficient than other general purposes decomposition. It refactors matrices
 * using one of the two following equations:<br>
 * <br>
 * L*L<sup>T</sup>=A<br>
 * R<sup>T</sup>*R=A<br>
 * <br>
 * where L is a lower triangular matrix and R is an upper traingular matrix.<br>
