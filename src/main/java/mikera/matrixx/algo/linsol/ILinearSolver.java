/**
 * <p>
 * An implementation of LinearSolver solves a linear system or inverts a matrix.
 * It masks more complex implementation details, while giving the programmer
 * control over memory management and performance. To quickly detect nearly
 * singular matrices without computing the SVD the {@link #quality()} function
 * is provided.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A linear system is defined as: A*X = B.<br>
 * where A &isin; &real; <sup>m &times; n</sup>, X &isin; &real; <sup>n &times;
 * p</sup>, B &isin; &real; <sup>m &times; p</sup>. Different implementations
 * can solve different types and shapes in input matrices and have different
 * memory and runtime performance.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To solve a system:<br>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Call {@link #setA(Matrix)}
 * <li>Call {@link #solve(Matrix, Matrix)}.
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To invert a matrix:<br>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Call {@link #setA(Matrix)}
 * <li>Call {@link #invert(Matrix)}.
 * </ol>
 * A matrix can also be inverted by passing in an identity matrix to solve, but
 * this will be slower and more memory intensive than the specialized invert()
 * function.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Depending upon the implementation, input matrices might be
 * overwritten by the solver. This reduces memory and computational requirements
 * and give more control to the programmer. If the input matrices need to be not
 * modified then {@link org.ejml.alg.dense.linsol.LinearSolverSafe} can be used.
 * The functions {@link #modifiesA()} and {@link #modifiesB()} specify which
 * input matrices are being modified.
